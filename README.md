# MODELLING-CHAPYGIN-S-BALL-THEORY.
 The Chaplygin ball is a dynamical system that models a rigid ball rolling without slipping on a horizontal plane, where the ball’s mass distribution is non-uniform which means that it's center of mass is displaced from it's geometric center.

The no-slip constraint in this condition means:

r˙=ω×a
r
˙
=ω×a

where

r˙
r
˙
 = velocity of the contact point,

ω
ω = angular velocity,
and 
a
a = vector from the center of mass to the contact point.

This was  named after Sergey Chaplygin (1897), who first derived the motion.
The Chaplygin ball system is a nonholonomic system;This makes it non-Hamiltonian in the standard sense, but remarkably, the system can be reduced to a Hamiltonian form using a Chaplygin reducing multiplier (a time reparametrization technique).
The equations of motion are typically written as:

M˙=M×ω
M
˙
=M×ω
γ˙=γ×ω

=γ×ω

where:

M

γ

M depends on the inertia tensor
