# MODELLING-CHAPYGIN-S-BALL-THEORY.
 In MATLAB, a ball’s motion is studied in three stationary states: stable equilibrium, unstable equilibrium, and neutral equilibrium. The motion is modeled in matrix form, solved with Runge–Kutta (RK4), &amp; shown using 2D plots to compare behaviors &amp; errors..
